Specifically: expected statuses are (in intended order of progression) 
- *none*
- *OCR*
- *BOOKED [name]*
- *ROUGH [name(s)]* (content all present, but formatting or similar needs fixed)
- *DONE [name(s)]* (entirely done)

Of course this is all flexible if unforeseen situations arise… 

Once a section is *DONE* or *POLISHED*, anyone who has carefully read it can add *PROOFED [nameX]*, so we can ensure that (if possible) each section gets proofread by at least one additional person.

Suggestion: to start with, leave space for people to work in contiguous blocks.  E.g. if person A has just done sections 1.1–1.5 and has 1.6 booked, then person B should not book 1.7 or 1.8; person B should start contributing at, say, 1.10 or 2.1.  Of course, once we are nearly done and filling in smaller gaps, this no longer make sense.
